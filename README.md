A seismic attribute analysis was recently performed on the F3 Block (North Sea) 3D dataset using Python. This project aimed to enhance structural and stratigraphic interpretation through a combination of signal processing techniques and advanced attribute extraction.

🔧 Key Workflows Implemented:
▪️ Instantaneous attributes — Amplitude, Phase, and Frequency via Hilbert Transform
▪️ Discontinuity detection using:
 ▫️ Marfurt Coherence
 ▫️ Gersztenkorn’s Eigenstructure-based Coherence
 ▫️ Gradient Structure Tensor (GST) method

📊 The results revealed subtle geological features like faults, thin beds, and stratigraphic variations—demonstrating the power of Python in quantitative seismic interpretation.

A special thanks to Agile Scientific for their valuable open-source resources and contributions to the geoscience community 🙏
